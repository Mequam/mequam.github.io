				<h3>Rules</h3>
			
				<h4>Time Constraints</h4>
			
				<p><em>You have two weeks starting from April 22nd to finish the game.</em></p>	
				<p> 
				That gives you until club starts on <nobr>May 6th</nobr> to finish any developments as we 
				will be <a href="#rating">rating eachothers games</a> during club that day.</p>
						
				<h4>Group Constraints</h4>
				<div class="container text-container">
				<p>
					<em>You can be in teams of up to 3 people when working on your game.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Any more and it can be difficult for every team member to enjoy
					the fun that goes into game creation.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you REAAALY want to to have more than 3 people on a team
					this is more a rule of thumb for your enjoyment than the game, 
					just make sure to talk to me before hand.
				<p>
				</div>
				<h4>Game Constraints</h4>	
				<p>
				Your game can be any form of game you can think of board,card,video 
				or even sports! As long as it adheres to the theme in some way, is original, and obviously school apropriate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>All games must be submited with instructions on how to play them
					and any peices required for play.</em>	
				</p>
				<p>
					Players should be able to pick up a copy of your game, read the rules and more or less figure out how to play without you helping them.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h4 id="rating">Rating</h4>

				<p>
					To determine which game wins the competition, all games will be 
					rated on a sclae of 1-20 in the following 5 categories.
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li><em>Fun</em> <br> 
							<span class="tab tab-info">How fun is the game?</span>
						</li>
						<li><em>Explanation</em> <br> 
							<span class="tab tab-info">Is the explanation easy to follow?</span>
						</li>	
						<li><em>Mechanical Uniqueness</em> <br>
							<span class="tab tab-info">How creative are the mechanics?</span>
						</li>	
						<li><em>Presentation</em> <br> 
							<span class="tab tab-info">How does the artwork look?</span>
						</li>
						<li><em>Adherence To Theme</em> <br> 
							<span class="tab tab-info">Does it make sense with the theme?</span>
						</li>
					</ol>
				<p>To find the final score for a game the average of its five scores will
				added to the posotive dnd modifires <nobr>(floor((x-10)/2))</nobr> of its scores.</p>
				<p>The largest of these scores will win the game.</p>
				<p>In the event of a tie, dice will be used to determine the winner. 
				unless winning club members agree to an alternative fair method :).</p>

				<p class="important">don't worry too much about computing your final score, just try and do the best you can in each of the catigories and you will do fine!</p>
